# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, which showcases my projects and experiences. It is also itself, a showcase of my personal style and interests. I hope you like it!

It was deployed using Firebase, and utilises firebase storage and functions. The Steam web API is also used to show my most recently played game!
